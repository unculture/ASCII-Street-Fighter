As I didn't get to touch the keyboard at all at the dojo, I thought 
I'd spend a happy couple of hours with a glass of wine recreating our 
team's game from scrath. 

Don't look too closely at the code... 

FIGHT!

It's 2-player:

python fighter.py

'e' - Move player 1 up
'd' - Send fireball hurtling dangerously towards player 2
'c' - Move player 1 down

'o' - Move player 1 up
'k' - Send fireball hurtling dangerously towards player 1
'm' - Move player 1 down

'q' quits the game
